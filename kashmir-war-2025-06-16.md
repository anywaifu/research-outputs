### **Research Analysis: The May 2025 India-Pakistan Conflict**

**Executive Summary**

The provided sources detail a significant, short-duration military conflict between India and Pakistan that occurred from May 7 to May 10, 2025. Referred to as the "Four-Day Conflict" (Source 6), this near-war was the most serious confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades. The conflict was triggered by a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists (Source 1, 6). India retaliated with a series of missile and drone strikes codenamed "Operation Sindoor" (Source 5, 7). Pakistan responded with its own strikes, codenamed "Operation Bunyan al-Marsus" (Source 7). The conflict was characterized by the first-time use of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and extensive drone warfare between the two nations (Source 6). After four days of escalating hostilities, a ceasefire was brokered on May 10, primarily through the diplomatic intervention of the United States (Source 3, 6). However, the ceasefire was fragile, with both sides accusing the other of violations within hours of the agreement (Source 3). The crisis was marked by intense information warfare, with both nations making conflicting claims about military successes and losses (Source 6).

### **Detailed Timeline of the Conflict**

The events unfolded rapidly over several days, with key developments often occurring within 24-hour cycles.

**1. Pre-Conflict Tensions (April 22 – May 6, 2025)**

*   **The Trigger (April 22):** A terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, killed 26 tourists. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility (Source 1, 6). India blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad denied (Source 3, 7).
*   **Diplomatic Escalation:** In the days following the attack, India and Pakistan engaged in a series of diplomatic and economic retaliations. India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, and both nations imposed visa revocations and airspace closures (Source 1).
*   **Warning of Imminent Strike (April 29):** Pakistan’s Minister for Information, Attaullah Tarar, publicly warned that Islamabad had "credible intelligence" of an impending Indian military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours (Source 1).
*   **International Calls for Restraint:** The United States and the United Nations urged both countries to de-escalate. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres engaged with their Indian and Pakistani counterparts to prevent a confrontation (Source 1, 5).

**2. The Four-Day Conflict (May 7 – May 10, 2025)**

*   **Day 1: India's "Operation Sindoor" (May 7)**
    *   India launched punitive missile and drone strikes, dubbed "Operation Sindoor," against nine alleged militant infrastructure sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir (Source 5, 6). The strikes targeted locations including Muridke and Bahawalpur, deep inside Pakistani Punjab, using weapons like the BrahMos and SCALP-EG cruise missiles (Source 6).
    *   Pakistan claimed the strikes hit civilian areas, killing 40 people (Source 6). India claimed to have killed "over 100 terrorists" (Source 6).
    *   In the hours following the strikes, Pakistan claimed to have shot down multiple Indian Air Force (IAF) jets over Indian territory. A *Washington Post* investigation found evidence of at least three crash sites in India involving aircraft types not operated by Pakistan (Source 6).

*   **Day 2-3: Drone Duels and Escalation (May 8-9)**
    *   The conflict shifted to a new domain of warfare, with both sides engaging in "drone duels" (Source 6). Pakistan launched waves of drones into India, which India claimed were largely unsuccessful probes against its air defenses (Source 6).
    *   India retaliated with its own drone strikes on May 8 and 9, targeting Pakistani air defense radar systems using Israeli-origin Harpy and Harop loitering munitions (Source 6).
    *   Simultaneously, intense cross-border firing erupted along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, breaking a 2021 ceasefire and causing dozens of military and civilian casualties (Source 3, 6).

*   **Day 4: Climax and Ceasefire (May 10)**
    *   Hostilities peaked on the night of May 9-10. India launched a large, coordinated attack on at least eleven Pakistani military installations, including airbases (Nur Khan, Sarghoda), command centers, and radar sites, using a mix of decoy drones and standoff missiles (Source 3, 6). Satellite imagery confirmed damage to at least six Pakistani airfields (Source 6).
    *   Pakistan launched its own retaliatory strikes, codenamed "Operation Bunyan al-Marsus," targeting Indian military bases with larger kamikaze drones and, for the first time, conventionally armed Fatah-I and Fatah-II short-range ballistic missiles (Source 3, 6, 7). India claimed its air defense systems intercepted most of these attacks, acknowledging only "limited damage" at four locations (Source 6).
    *   Amid fears of further escalation, the U.S. administration, led by President Trump, VP J.D. Vance, and Secretary Rubio, intensified diplomatic efforts (Source 3, 6). Following a "long night of talks," a "full and immediate ceasefire" was announced, set to begin at 5:00 p.m. local time on May 10 (Source 3, 6).
    *   Within hours of the deadline, both India and Pakistan accused each other of violating the agreement, with reports of explosions and gunfire along the LoC (Source 3).

### **Key Themes and Patterns**

1.  **Modern Standoff Warfare:** The conflict was a significant showcase of modern military technology. It marked the first time India and Pakistan engaged in extensive drone warfare against each other and the first use of cruise missiles (by India) and conventionally-armed ballistic missiles (by Pakistan) in their rivalry (Source 6). Notably, there was no evidence of manned aircraft from either side crossing into enemy airspace, highlighting the perceived threat of modern air defense systems (Source 6).

2.  **Calibrated Escalation and Retaliation:** Both nations appeared to follow a tit-for-tat strategy, carefully calibrating their responses. India's initial strikes targeted "terrorist infrastructure," avoiding military targets (Source 6). Subsequent Indian strikes were framed as proportionate responses to Pakistani drone attacks (Source 6). This pattern of controlled escalation, while dangerous, suggests both sides sought to manage the conflict and avoid an all-out war under the nuclear shadow (Source 6).

3.  **Crucial Role of International Mediation:** The United States played a pivotal role in de-escalating the crisis. High-level engagement from President Trump, VP Vance, and Secretary Rubio was instrumental in brokering the May 10 ceasefire (Source 3, 6). Other international actors, including the UN, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, also called for restraint and were involved in diplomatic efforts (Source 1, 3, 5).

4.  **Pervasive Information Warfare:** The conflict was accompanied by an "exceptional" level of misinformation and disinformation from both sides (Source 6). India and Pakistan made conflicting and often unsubstantiated claims regarding casualties, downed aircraft, and the success of their strikes (Source 3, 5, 6). This information war complicated efforts to establish a factual narrative of events as they unfolded (Source 6).

5.  **The Nuclear Shadow:** While overt nuclear signaling was lower than in some past crises, the fact that both combatants are nuclear-armed states heavily conditioned their actions (Source 6). A key moment of tension was the announcement—and subsequent cancellation—of a meeting of Pakistan's National Command Authority, the body that oversees its nuclear arsenal (Source 6). U.S. officials reportedly acted on "alarming intelligence" that raised fears of the conflict spiraling into a nuclear exchange (Source 6).
